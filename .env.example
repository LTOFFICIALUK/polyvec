#    - Uses API routes to fetch market data and place trades
#
# 2. WebSocket Service (ws-service/) - Must run on VPS/server

#    - Provides real-time price data via WebSocket
#    - Requires persistent connection (not suitable for serverless)
#
# 3. PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB - Must run on VPS/server or hosted service
#    - Stores price history for charts
#    - Can use: Railway, Supabase, or self-hosted on VPS
#
# For Vercel deployment:
# - Set WS_SERVICE_URL to your ws-service server (e.g., http://your-vps-ip:8081)
# - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_URL to wss://your-domain.com or ws://your-vps-ip:8081
# - Set DATABASE_URL to your hosted PostgreSQL instance
